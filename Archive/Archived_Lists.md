## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Purpose of Archive

- **Transparency:** To show what was previously recommended and why it was changed or removed.
- **Reference:** Some users may find value in older categorizations or lists that included sites which are now inactive.

> **Note:** The resources in these archived lists may be outdated, inactive, or no longer recommended. Always refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for the current, curated list.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes

1.  **Not Maintained:** Links in archived lists are not checked for validity. Many may be broken or lead to inactive websites.
2.  **Not Recommended:** The curation standards for the main list have improved. Archived content does not meet the current quality bar.
3.  **For Reference Only:** Use these lists to see the history of the project, not to find current job opportunities.
